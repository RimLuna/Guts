        <!-- <div class="content"><p>Ever since he was born out of his mother's corpse hanging from a tree, a group of mercenaries found him and was adopted by Shisu. However, a plague appeared being a result of his adopted mother's death. With nowhere else to turn to, he found the leader of the mercenary, Gambino to train him into a real warrior. at the age of 6. When he was 9, he killed his first man. When Gambino started to abuse (sexual, emotional and physical), he later killed him way too far. After that, Guts decided to venture the free world until he was recruited by a band of mercenaries, The Band Of Hawks, where he was comfortable and was able to relax with them. But then when Griffith, leader of the clan, was furious that he didn't become king, he decided to lead the mercenary group of summoned groups of demons, they start brutally killing every single people in the clan in front of Guts. Then Griffith started raping Gut's girlfriend, Casca and was forced to amputate his arm (later was replaced with a mechanical arm) and gouged his eye out. Guts swore himself he will gain revenge and kill Griffith for what he have done. Wow, who else feels sympathetic? </p></div>  -->
